    This computes the dot product between the normal of the surface (vNormal) and the view direction
    (vViewDir). The dot product returns a value between -1 and 1, which represents the angle
    between the two vectors. A value close to 1 means the camera is looking directly at the
    screen (front view), a value close to -1 means the camera is completely tilted away from
    the surface.

    max(dot(vNormal, vViewDir), 0.2)

    By using max(., 0.2), we ensure that the view angle is never below 0.2. This prevents the
    contrast from becoming too intense or the image from going completely black when the camera is
    excessively tilted.

  This raises the view angle (viewAngle) to the power of uContrastFactor (this parameter allows you
  to adjust the intensity of the effect). If uContrastFactor is low (e.g., 1), the contrast
  variation will be smoother. If itâ€™s higher (e.g., 3), the effect will be more pronounced.

  Blends two values:
  - 0.5 (minimum contrast, dark, when the surface is tilted)
  - 1.2 (maximum contrast, bright, when the surface is viewed head-on)
